#Start working with CSS

This is a GitHub repo for a first assignment with CSS.

Before you can play, you need to learn some things about GitHub. Do you see the folder above named *github-basics*? Go into that folder, follow all the instructions there, and then come back.

##Forking a repo

You're back? Good. With your GitHub account and your app set up, you can now make a copy of this repo for yourself.

A repo can contain lots of files and folders, or few, or none (that would be an empty repo). Each GitHub user can have unlimited public repos. As many as you want.

Find the button that says Fork (near the top of the page, right side). Click it.
This makes a new, independent copy of the entire repo under YOUR GitHub username.

**Fork:** Your repo will not be changed when the original owner changes the original. Likewise, you can change your copy, and it will not affect the original. In most cases, you will only fork ONCE for one repo. (There is a way to update so that yours matches changes made to the original, but let’s leave that aside for now.)

The repo does not exist on your computer YET.

##Cloning a repo

Find the button that says **Clone in Desktop** (middle of the page, right side). Click it. You will be asked to choose a place on your hard drive for this repo. Put it inside the folder you made inside Documents just for this purpose.

**Clone** uses your app (GitHub for Mac or GitHub for Windows) to make a copy of the entire repo on your hard drive, and this copy is tethered to the version on the GitHub.com site (as you will see). You might clone a repo more than once.

**NOTE:** Windows users, if you are getting an error message, or your clone is not working, [please read this](http://babydatajournalism.tumblr.com/post/85108267252/github-for-windows-cant-clone-repo-stops-at-9).

##What you should have now

At GitHub.com, when you go to your user page/profile, you’ll see a link to your new repo (click it to view the repo). On your hard drive, you’ll see a folder with the same name as that repo. (These two are tethered together, thanks to Git.)

* *My* user page is: https://github.com/macloo
* Yours will be similar, but with your username instead of macloo.
* The name of the repo you forked and cloned is: CSS-intro-with-GitHub
* That name is both the name of your new repo AND the folder name on your hard drive.
* In the app, you will see all repos listed by name. Probably you only have one repo, so far.
