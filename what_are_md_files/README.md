#What Are .md Files?

Files that end with the file extension `.md` are written in Markdown. This is a simplified markup language (HTML is also a markup language).

On GitHub, a Markdown file inside a repo can be opened and read like the file you are reading now (this is, in fact, a Markdown file), whereas the `.html` and `.css` files, etc., open in code view.

On GitHub, when a Markdown file is named `README.md` (like this file), it will automatically open when you enter the folder it's inside. This provides a handy way to tell people about the code in that folder.

In this case, there is no code in the folder! There's only the Markdown file. This file.

You do not need to write any Markdown files for you assignment. I just thought you might be curious about them.
