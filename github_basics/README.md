#GitHub Basics

These are your instructions for getting started with GitHub.

To learn why GitHub is important, you can read [What Exactly Is GitHub Anyway?](http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/) and/or [How GitHub Conquered Google, Microsoft, and Everyone Else](http://www.wired.com/2015/03/github-conquered-google-microsoft-everyone-else/).

##What is a repo?

Right now you’re looking at a GitHub repo. “Repo” is short for “repository.” A repo is a place to store code. More important, it is a place to keep a record of all your changes. It’s also great for sharing and collaborating.

##Sign up for GitHub

So you can play too, you need to get a GitHub account (if you don’t have one yet). There should be a “Sign Up” button at the top of this page.

**Note:** Think about your username before you choose it. This is a professional space. Your username will be visible to strangers.

GitHub is all free unless you want some special features, such as hiding your work from the world. (All free GitHub repos are public.)

You can have only ONE GitHub account per email address.

##Download a GitHub app

Download [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/). Also free.

Install it. I will refer to this as “the app.”

Go to the Help section at that website (Mac or Windows, above) and open the “Getting started” or “First launch” link there.

Using the instructions as needed, LINK your GitHub account to the app (GitHub for Mac or GitHub for Windows).

##Get organized

Time for some thinking: GitHub expects things to be stable on your hard drive(s). That means you need to decide very deliberately WHERE on your hard drive a folder associated with GitHub will be. DO NOT associate GitHub with folders on your Desktop!

Go *inside* your Documents folder and make a **new folder** there. This ONE folder  will contain all other folders that you will associate with GitHub. You might name that folder Webwork, or Datawork, or Code, or some other general term. Name it something that makes sense to you.

Your GitHub app is going to coordinate things for you between the Web (GitHub) and your hard drive, but GitHub can’t think, and GitHub can’t figure out that you have moved a folder or changed its name.

To get you started, we will **fork** and then **clone** a repo. (Those GitHub words will all be defined as we go along.)

**Go back to the top of this repo now,** and you’ll learn how. Instructions are there.

To get back to the top of any repo, find the link with its name in the upper left area of the page at GitHub.
