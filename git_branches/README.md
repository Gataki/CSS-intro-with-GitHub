#Git Branches

Now you're going to do something rather sophisticated in your GitHub app.

You're going to create a new **branch.** This will enable you to make changes and even create new files without affecting any of the original files in your repo.

More important, by working only in a branch, later you will be able to make a **pull request** to the original repo. This can only be done from a branch. If the owner of the original repo allows it, your branch can be **merged** into that original, incorporating your changes and new files into it.

Before you create a branch, make sure you have done everything [here](../github_basics) and [here](../). Don't skip anything.

##See branches in the GitHub app

The app has a tab named "Branches." Click that. You should see one branch in the main window. Its name is "master" (that is always the name for the first branch in a repo). It has a checkmark to show you it is the current branch -- the one you are in now.

Branches are like parallel universes. What happens in one branch has no effect on any other branches -- unless you **merge** two branches.

The "parallel universes" analogy is really appropriate, because when you are in branch A, you cannot see any of the files in branch B, even though they are all local files on your hard drive. There is no chance of polluting any other branch.

##Create a new branch

In your GitHub app, in the Branches window, find the tiny plus sign and click it.

You should see text saying, "Create a new branch off master," and a box to type in. Name the new branch. My suggestion: Name it *sandbox* (it's a place to play). Or name it *assignment* since that's what you'll be working on in the new branch.
