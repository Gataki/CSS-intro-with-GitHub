#Git Branches

Now you're going to do something rather sophisticated in your GitHub app.

You're going to create a new **branch.** This will enable you to make changes and even create new files without affecting any of the original files in your repo.

More important, by working only in a branch, later you will be able to make a **pull request** to the original repo. This can only be done from a branch. If the owner of the original repo allows it, your branch can be **merged** into that original, incorporating your changes and new files into it. This is how thousands of people collaborate and contribute to [open-source](http://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) projects.

Before you create a branch, make sure you have done everything [here](../github_basics) and [here](../../../). Don't skip anything.

##See branches in the GitHub app

The Mac app has a tab named "Branches." Click the tab, and you'll see your branches.

The Windows app has a round branch button to the left of the word *master* (your current branch). Click the button, and you'll see a list of your branches.

You have only one branch now. Its name is *master* (that is always the name for the first branch in a repo). It has a checkmark to show you it is the current branch -- the one you are in now.

Branches are like parallel universes. What happens in one branch has no effect on any other branches.

The "parallel universes" analogy is really appropriate, because when you are in branch A, you cannot see any of the files in branch B, even though they are all local files on your hard drive. There is no chance of polluting any other branch.

##Create a new branch

Mac: In your GitHub app, in the Branches window or list, find the tiny plus sign on the *master* branch and click it. You should see text saying, "Create a new branch off master," and a box to type in.

Windows: In your GitHub app, at the top of the drop-down list, you'll see a box to type in. Make sure you see the checkmark on *master.*

Name the new branch. My suggestion: Name it *assignment* since that's what you'll be working on in the new branch.

You should see your second branch immediately.

##Switching between branches

This can be tricky, so pay attention. Remember the idea of "parallel universes"? Keep that in mind, because branches are NOT like folders. You can't simply move stuff back and forth between them. But *you* can move between branches.

Mac: In your app, still in the Branches window, double-click the new branch. There should be a clear indicator (a checkmark) to tell you which branch you are in now. You'll see the name of the current branch at the top left of the app window.

Windows: In your app, the name of the current branch appears at the top right of the app window. If you're not in *assignment* now, open the branch list and click to switch.

##Your assignment

For this assignment, I want you to do EVERYTHING in your *assignment* branch. Do not make any edits or other changes while you are in *master.* So **switch to your *assignment* branch,** and then **stay in it.**

This will allow you to do the pull request successfully, later.

##Next steps

To continue with your assignment, go into the folder above named *assignment* and follow the instructions there. Remember to stay in your *assignment* branch! Do not switch branches again.
